  /*** TEAM A AND B NEED TO COORDINATE
  
  /**TEAM A -- BEES
 * 1/ Create a  file to hold a  Bee Class (i.e. Bee.js)
 * 2/ Create the Bee Class : a constructor which takes a position, size, color and a home beehive (SEE TEAM B) as parameters
 * 3/ In the Bee Class: Create a renderBee() method -> which essentially creates a HTML element(s) 
 - could be  * an image element :) or an svg .... representing a Bee... (see Sun or Flower for inspiration)
 * 4/ Create an animateBee() method in the Bee class - which will make a given Bee move around the garden - use the requestAnimationFrame() 
 * 5/ In garden.js add at least 5 new Bees to the garden (in an array) - 
 * all different sizes, colors etc... and set their position to be at their home Beehive's position
 * 6/ and then call the animateBee() method on all the Bees)
 * 7/Implement the functionality  to allow for bees to periodically return to their home beehive (SEE TEAM B) to rest :)

  * 1/ Create a file to hold a Bee Hive (i.e. BeeHive.js)

  - could be * an image element :) or an svg .... representing a BeeHive.. (see Sun or Flower for inspiration)
 * 4/ Create a subtle animation affecting the bee-hive ... (using setInterval(), setTimeout, or requestAnimationFrame) 
* 5/ In garden.js add at least new 2 Beehives  to the garden (in an array) - and ensure that they have bees linked to them
* 6/ Add a click event to each beehive such that when clicked on -> you count the number of bees (SEE TEAM A for collab) "at home" 
  and visually display the result
