## Description

This description should help the reader understand what the program is, anything they should know to be able to experience it (controls, special features, etc.), and what the desired user experience is. For example:

> This is the medium version of my snake game.
> In the game, you are a small snake, and you need to grow.
> The goal is to gather up 25 other snakes to win.
> The obstacles present are
    > touching the corners will make the player lose the game. 
    > touching the black snake will make the player lose the game 
        > the black snake's position is random and changes everytime a food(snake) is eaten(gathered)
